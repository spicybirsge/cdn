# cdn

A [cdn](https://cdn.shaheerahamed.me) for me to deliver my content you can use it too if you want.

## Installation

1. The usual download and install packages.
2. Add env vars as mentioned in `.env.example`. All vars that start with `CLOUDINARY` are from [cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/).
3. You also might have to change the response in [this](https://github.com/spicybirsge/cdn/blob/4d318ea8e243505673db7471232dc2c04b75ec32/index.js#L37) line to your domain. 
4. Done.
